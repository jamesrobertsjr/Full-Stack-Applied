# Black & Hispanic Tech Summit â€” Full Stack Applied

In this workshop, you will learn about how to connect a front-end React application to a backend REST API. Specifically, we will configure the React Movie Picker application to utilize the Movie Picker API as its data source.

## Requirements

This workshop builds on top of the applications built in the React 101 and API 101 courses. You will need the following apps completed as a starting point for this workshop:

- `movie-picker` [React app](https://github.com/Black-and-Hispanic-Tech-Summit/React-101/tree/main/movie-picker)
- `Lab-3-Movies-Service` [Express API](https://github.com/Black-and-Hispanic-Tech-Summit/APIs-101/tree/main/finished-movie-service)

You can either use the applications you completed from these workshops, or you can pull down the completed versions from GitHub at the start of this workshop.

### Environment Requirements

Ensure that Node version >= 16.0.0 and npm version >= 8.5 are installed on your machine. You can install node here: <https://nodejs.org/en/>

## Course Materials

You will also find step-by-step [Instructions](./Instructions.md) to follow along with that include directions on how to complete this workshop.
